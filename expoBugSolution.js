The solution often involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and reinstall the packages.  Sometimes, corrupted package installations can lead to these problems.
2. **Check Expo CLI version:** Make sure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI. Run `expo upgrade`.
3. **Examine error logs carefully:** Pay attention to any error messages in the terminal output. They may provide clues regarding the root cause, often relating to specific modules or configurations.
4. **Check native module dependencies:** Ensure that all native modules are compatible with your Expo SDK version and project setup. Review the documentation for each module.
5. **Investigate potential conflicts:** Conflicts between different libraries or native modules can sometimes cause these issues. Try temporarily disabling or removing suspect modules to see if the problem resolves.
6. **Clear Expo cache:** If all else fails, try clearing the Expo cache: `expo prebuild --clean`
7. **Restart your machine:**  A simple restart can occasionally clear up transient OS-level issues that might be interfering with the Expo CLI.

If the problem persists, consider reporting the issue to the Expo community forums or filing a bug report on the Expo GitHub repository.  Include detailed information about your project setup, dependencies, and the exact error messages you are encountering.
